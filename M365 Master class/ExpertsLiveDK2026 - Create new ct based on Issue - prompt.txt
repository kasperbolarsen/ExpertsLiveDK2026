create a script that goes to the conent type hub of a specified tenant, finds the Issue ct and creates new ct named ELDK26Issues based on Issue. Once the ct is available I want a new site column added to the new ct. 
The site column is named Geo Relations and is a taxonomy field connected to the existing term set by the same name. The term group of Geolocation is named  Geo Relations. The site column is single selection and be a optional field.
the content type url is https://m365thinking.sharepoint.com/sites/Contenttypehub

If there is any questions then ask

I prefer the indentation style to be like this:
try
{
}
catch
{
}
